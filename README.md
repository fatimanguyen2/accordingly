# Accordingly
Accordingly gives users advice on what to wear or bring according to the environmental factors such as weather and uv index during their trip/activity so theyâ€™re not gonna get caught out in the rain without an umbrella. We like to think of it as the loving advice of a mom or dad would give before you leave home. To accomplish this, our app has two main views, the home and schedule.
